## Content

Contains PMU (phase measurement unit) data for a single phase on a bus that includes photovoltaic power generation (solar power). The purpose of this dataset is to detect anomalies that appear as voltage sags that occur due to drops of power thanks to cloud cover, equipment failure, or operational changes.

The file has the following columns:

- Timestamp (ns)
- Human-Readable Time (UTC)
- Volts
