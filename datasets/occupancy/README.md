## Content

Experimental data used for binary classification (room occupancy) from Temperature,Humidity,Light and CO2. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute.

- date time year-month-day hour:minute:second
- Temperature, in Celsius
- Relative Humidity, %
- Light, in Lux
- CO2, in ppm
- Humidity Ratio, Derived quantity from temperature and relative humidity, in - kgwater-vapor/kg-air
- Occupancy, 0 or 1, 0 for not occupied, 1 for occupied status
