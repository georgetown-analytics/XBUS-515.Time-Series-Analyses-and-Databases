# XBUS-515 Time Series Analyses and Databases

Workshops, code, and examples for the Time Series Analytics course in the Advanced Data Science Certificate.

## Getting Started

Please clone the repository prior to class - note that there is a large dataset included in the repository and it may take a while to download. You can then install the Python dependencies for the notebooks as follows:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will be assigned breakout rooms to work in pairs or small groups. Run the notebooks using the `jupyter` command.
